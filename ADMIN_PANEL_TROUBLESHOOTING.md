## 🔧 How to Access Admin Panel

### Step 1: Login
1. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Login with:
   - Email: `dashboard@edulearn.local`
   - Password: `password`

### Step 2: Access Admin Features
After login, you should see:

1. **In the Sidebar** (left side):
   - Look for "Admin Management" dropdown
   - Click to expand and see:
     - Roles Management
     - Permissions Management
     - User Management

2. **In the Top Navigation** (top of page):
   - Admin navigation bar with:
     - Roles
     - Permissions
     - User Management

### Step 3: Direct URLs
You can also access directly:

- Permissions: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/permissions`
- Users: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/users`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Steps

### If you still can't see the admin menu:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   ```bash
   # Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   ```

2. **Clear Laravel Cache**
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   php artisan permission:cache-reset
   ```

3. **Check User Permissions**
   ```bash
   php test_permissions.php
   ```

4. **Verify Login**
   - Make sure you're logged in as Super Admin
   - Check if you see the debug information (yellow boxes)

5. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Check for any JavaScript errors
   - Check for any CSS issues

### Debug Information
I've added debug information that will show:
- Yellow debug box in sidebar: "Debug: Admin user - [username]"
- Yellow debug box in top nav: "Debug: Admin user detected - [username] ([role])"

If you see these debug boxes, the admin features should be working.
